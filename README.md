# Camp 7 Final Project

- [ ] Get rid of unused Imports -> Comamnd Palette -> Organize imports
- [ ] Make sure to always validate the body on API Routes -> Zod
- [ ] Try to let the content determine the height of an element, before setting a fixed height
- [ ] Use derrived state
- [ ] Try to define the data source of a component in its props -> makes it more flexible
- [ ] Sometimes it's not worth it making components super generic -> Then it's ok to write two or more components
